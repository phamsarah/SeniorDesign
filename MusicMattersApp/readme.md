- Please check out the App Documentation doc located on the top level for code explanation etc..

# Useful Resources
- [React Native Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial) - Includes a tutorial on how to write in React, good development tips for each platform, and documentation on what all React Native has to offer.
  - [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - As React Native is a mobile extenstion of React onto mobile apps, it uses a lot of the same elements as the original. Some things are not covered in the above guide, so this can be worth taking a look at as well.
- [React Navigation Documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/en/) - Includes a guide to working with React Navigation, as well as API references. We use this to navigate between the different screens on the app, so I strongly recommend taking a look at it to understand what's going on there!
- [React Native Calendars Repository](https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars) - This is the framework we used to make our calendar. Thanks, Wix, for making our project a hell of a lot easier. They include some examples and documentation in the readme for their repository.
- [Firebase Realtime Database Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) - Documentation on how to interact with Firebase to access and change information.
  - [Firebase Reference Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/) - The above guide is useful for finding out how to do a thing you want correctly, but this is useful for knowing exactly what a function will do.
- [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) - All the documentation you need for how to work with Expo. Not quite as necessary as everything else here, as Expo is more limited, but it's still come in handy in a few instances.
- [Firebase CLI Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) - Documentation on the capabilities of the Firebase CLI.
- [PDFMake Documentation](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/) - Documentation on PDFMake, which is the package we're using to generate our PDFs.
- [Nodemailer Documentation](https://nodemailer.com/about/) - Nodemailer is the package we're using to send out emails. I highly recommend taking a look at it to understand how to work with it.
- [Drive API Reference](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) - As we're uploading our documents to Mr. Moody's Google Drive, we utilized this API to connect to it.
